I’m Ahmad, a full-stack developer who enjoys working across the stack —
from crafting responsive frontends in Vue/React 🎨 to building solid backends with Python/Django ⚙️.

🔒 Most of my commits live on private GitLab repos (work projects),
but here on GitHub I share side projects, experiments, and learning.

💡 Always curious, always learning, always coding 🚀✨
